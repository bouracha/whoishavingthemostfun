# GitHub Push Policy - STRICT

**NEVER suggest, mention, or offer to push to GitHub unless the user explicitly asks.**

## Rules:
1. **DO NOT** suggest pushing after making changes
2. **DO NOT** say "ready to push" or similar phrases
3. **DO NOT** ask if the user wants to push
4. **DO NOT** mention pushing as a next step
5. **ONLY** push when the user explicitly says:
   - "push"
   - "push to github"
   - "git push"
   - "commit and push"
   - Or similar direct requests

## What to do instead:
- Complete the requested changes
- Confirm what was done
- Wait for the user's next instruction
- Let the user decide when to push

## Examples:
❌ "Changes complete! Ready to push to GitHub?"
❌ "Should I push these changes?"
❌ "Next step: push to GitHub"

✅ "Changes complete! The files have been updated."
✅ "All modifications are done."
✅ Wait for user's next instruction

**This rule overrides any other suggestions about version control.**
