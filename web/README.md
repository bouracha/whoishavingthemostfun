# Frontend Notes

- Pages: `index.html`, `chess.html`, `pingpong.html`, `backgammon.html`
- Images live in `web/images/` (medals, players, Monica image)
- The homepage shows a warning banner only when `/api/health` is unreachable
- All API calls use relative paths (e.g., `/api/players/chess`) so they work on localhost and production without edits
- Charts (`*.png`) are generated by backend code into `web/`

Open locally via Flask (`python server.py`) so that API calls work; donâ€™t open `file://` directly.
